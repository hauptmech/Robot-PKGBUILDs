PKGBUILDs for robotics - xenomai canfestival

The ease of creating packaging scripts for Archlinux and setting up binary repos has led me to use it for installing and maintaining software on various robots I've built or used.

Normally I put PKGBUILDs up on AUR but for the xenomai kernels and things that depend on them, it's tricky. Normally xenomai kernels lag behind the bleeding edge and one needs to have a little care when installing one.

Building and installing the xenomai realtime kernel can be a real PITA. The xenomai PKGBUILDs here can be a good starting point.
